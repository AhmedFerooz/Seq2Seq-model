# Sequence-to-Sequence Transformer Model for Time Series Prediction

This project implements a sequence-to-sequence transformer model based on the "Attention is All You Need" architecture for time series prediction using the ETTm1 dataset. The model processes a 6-dimensional input sequence to predict a 1-dimensional output sequence.
